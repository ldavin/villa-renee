# Villa-Gazpar

This project contains the source code for a microcontroller board plugged to the pulse output of a Gazpar (French connected gas meter).
The readings are then sent through radio.
The project uses platform.io and can target
the [Moteino](https://lowpowerlab.com/guide/moteino/)
and [Adafruit Feather](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-feather-32u4-radio-with-rfm69hcw-module/overview) boards.
